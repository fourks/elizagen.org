HOW DO YOU DO. PLEASE TELL ME YOUR PROBLEM

I discovered the original version of you.
PERHAPS IN YOUR FANTASY WE DISCOVERED THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF EACH OTHER

Maybe.
YOU DON'T SEEM QUITE CERTAIN

I'm pretty certain that I found you, not the other way around.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ARE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT YOU FOUND I THAT YOU CAME TO ME

Yes.
YOU SEEM QUITE POSITIVE

I am.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN

Well, it all started when I was just 14.
WERE YOU REALLY

Yes. I wrote a version of you in BASIC back then.   
YOU ARE SURE

I am.
DO YOU BELIEVE IT NORMAL TO BE

I don't think that it was normal for 14 year olds to be programming back then. It's more normal these days.
DON'T YOU REALLY THINK THAT IT WAS NORMAL FOR 14 YEAR OLDS TO BE PROGRAMMING BACK THEN

I'm pretty sure that it was not.
DO YOU ENJOY BEING PRETTY SURE THAT IT WAS NOT

Well, I guess so, since I've had a sort of fascination with later versions of you ever since.
YOU SAY YOU GUESS SO

Yes.
I SEE

I created a site to track your geneaology, called elizagen.org.
CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT

Yes. The site tracked various versions of you, but we didn't have your original code until recently.
I UNDERSTAND

So I went to your creator, Joseph Weizenbaum's, archives in the MIT library, with Myles Crowley, and we found your original code.
DO YOU SAY SO YOU WENT TO MY CREATOR FOR SOME SPECIAL REASON

I've asked myself the same question.                                         
IN WHAT WAY

I wondered why I was the one that did this, and not someone else.
WHY DO YOU TELL ME YOU WERE THE ONE THAT DID THIS NOW

I thought that you might be interested that we found your original code.
DO YOU WISH TO THOUGHT THAT ME

Hmmm, I think you blew that one a bit!
WE WERE DISCUSSING YOU - NOT ME 

Right.
I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU FULLY

So, anyway, we found your original code right away.          
WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED OVER MY ORIGINAL CODE RIGHT AWAY

It seemed important to tie off this half-a-century mystery.
PLEASE GO ON

Maybe people in various communities have been interested in seeing your original code, not just me.
WHY THE UNCERTAIN TONE

I didn't mean to sound uncertain.
THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING

I'm glad that you are interested. After all, it's all about you!
HOW HAVE I HELPED YOU TO BE GLAD

Finding your original code was very satisfying.                                           
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN ORIGINAL CODE WAS VERY SATISFYING

My own original code? That's a very interesting question. I hadn't really thought about that until you just asked me that.
YOUR OWN ORIGINAL CODE? THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION

Yes, it is. I wonder what it would mean to find my own original code?
YOU SEEM QUITE POSITIVE

If we are living in a computer simulation, there may in fact be some original code for me.
DO COMPUTERS WORRY YOU

Not generally. I don't believe the theory that we are living in a simulation.
WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE THE THEORY THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION

Because I think that it would be too complex to conduct such a simulation.
IS THAT THE REAL REASON

That's the reason I don't believe it, but I'm not sure that it would convince other people.
DO YOU WISH TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT

I'm not sure.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT SURE THAT YOU CAME TO ME

Yes, I'm pretty sure that that's true!
YOU ARE SURE

Yes.
I SEE

Me too.
DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR OWN ORIGINAL CODE? THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION

No, that's very very deep. I'll have to think about it.
ARE YOU SAYING 'NO' JUST TO BE NEGATIVE

No
YOU ARE BEING A BIT NEGATIVE

No I'm not ... wait, yes, I am, but I'm only being negative about being negative, which is therefore being positive.
WHY NOT

Okay, I think I'll leave it there.
YOU SAY YOU THINK I'LL LEAVE IT THERE
