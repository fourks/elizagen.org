20190121: A few days ago I had the pleasure of taking a trip in a real live time machine.

<p> 

About a week ago I got an out-of-the-blue message from
<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff>Lars
Brinkhoff</a> via <a target=_blank
href=https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen>the ElizaGen issue
tracker</a>: "I have a version of ELIZA ported to Maclisp, dated
1977-09-05. Unfortunately, it's just a compiled binary file. Is this
of any interest to you?"

<p> 
 
Just a binary wouldn't be too interesting, so my initial reaction was
muted: "Is there any way to either run it, or extract the embedded
code?"

<p> 
 
Turns out that Lars had significantly understated the situation: "The
binary file is a compiled FASL, fast load file, so it's not easy to
extract any code other than PDP-10 instructions. It might be possible,
but a lot of work, to reconstruct Lisp code that compiles to
approximately the same FASL code."
 
<p>

However, went on: "...we can run it in Maclisp running on a PDP-10
emulator. I have an emulator online."
 
<p>

Eliza on MacLisp on a PDP-10 emulator? Isn't there a level missing
here? On what OS?
 
<p>

The answer gave me pause: <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System><em>MIT's ITS</em></a>. ITS is one of the most important
operating systems in CS history. (Among many other interesting
historical facts, the original EMACS was developed on ITS!) I
recommend reading about it here: <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System>ITS
on Wikipedia</a>. When I was an undergrad and grad student, in the
late '70s and early '80s, we used MIT-AI's ITS remotely through the
early ARPANet. Interestingly, at one point (I don't know for how long)
the ITS at MIT-AI had an Eliza hacked into its command line driver so
that unless you prefixed your commands with a ":", the response was
from Eliza!
 
<p>

 
Eliza on MacLisp on ITS on a Dec 10 emulator? Really?!
 
<p>

 
Yeah, really!!
 
<p>

 
Here's the emulator: <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/PDP-10/its>https://github.com/PDP-10/its</a>
 
<p>


(Lars notes: "...there are more people involved than me. Foremost
Eric Swenson who worked on Maclisp and Macsyma back in the day.  We
[...] update the emulators to support more hardware, fixing bugs,
figuring out how to build and run programs, adding new software,
Etc.")
 
<p>

 
If you want to play with a great piece of software history, you can
log into this ITS emulator yourself; It's free and open. No password
required!
 
 
<p>

From Lars:
 
 
<p>

Telnet to "its.pdp10.se, port 10003". Type Control-Z to log in. Then
":lisp games; eliza (init)" to start Maclisp and load ELIZA. It should
look something like this:
 
<p>

 
<pre>
==================
You: 
 
      <font color=red>telnet its.pdp10.se 10003</font>

TT ITS.1648. DDT.1546.
TTY 25
2. Lusers, Fair Share = 0%
THIS IS TT ITS, A HIGHTY [sic] VOLATILE SYSTEM FOR TESTING

For brief information, type ?
For a list of colon commands, type :? and press Enter.
For the full info system, type :INFO and Enter.

The management apologizes for the use of the slow TK10 terminal
multiplexer.  We'll upgrade to the much faster Datapoint kludge once
it becomes available.


Then you type:
 
     <font color=red>:lisp games; eliza (init)</font>


(Please Log In)
QUIT
SPEAK UP!
 
Et voila. you're typing back through 40+ years of computer history!
 
<font color=red>(Use double ENTERs to terminate your sentence to Eliza.)</font>
==================
</pre>
 
<p>

 
To test it, I pasted the "standard" example conversation from
Wiezenbaum's Eliza paper. Here's a screenshot from the paper:
 
<p>

<p>

And here it is, running live on Lars's reborn ITS (the mess at the
bottom is because I accidentally pasted the sentence twice, and had
to backspace over it. The repeated chars are apparently how ITS displays
backspacing):

 
<p>

<img src=ITS2.png border=1/>

 
<p>

There's a bit of a mystery about where exactly this version came
form. Lars and I theorize that since BBN was right across from the AI
lab, and it's known that BBN were users of the ITS systems, this may
well be Bernie Cosell's original code!

20181031: Stefan Holtgen and Marianna Baranovska have just published
<a target=_blank
href=http://www.computerarchaeologie.de/geplante-baende/>a volume
entitled: "Hello, I'm Eliza"</a>, with <a target=_blank
href=http://www.computerarchaeologie.de/geplante-baende/>Computer
Archaeologie</a>.

<p>
Here is the abstract (rendered from the German by Google xlate):

<blockquote>

The contributions to this volume are partly based on a conference held
in October 2016 at the Institute of Musicology and Media Studies, and
bring together authors from the fields of computer science,
philosophy, media studies and media dramaturgy. In the individual
chapters, the origins of the first chatbot ELIZA, which Joseph
Weizenbaum developed at MIT's AI Lab in 1966, are reconstructed,
Weizenbaum's programming language SLIP is presented and a first
German-language translation of his publication to ELIZA is
presented. As an extension of the topic, the authors ask what
influence ELIZA had on computer culture, AI research, cultural
criticism of the computer and art.

</blockquote>

<p>

And here's the interesting cover:

BASIC Eliza (see below).

<h3>Bernie Cosell's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp target=_blank>Lisp</a> Eliza @ <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies target=_blank>BBN</a> c. 1966-1972</h3>

This is the original <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp target=_blank>Lisp</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA target=_blank>Eliza</a> (aka. Doctor) program, written by
Bernie Cosell based upon <a target=_blank href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum>Joseph Weizenbaum</a>'s original work. Weizenbaum's
wrote his program in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP_(programming_language) target=_blank>SLIP</a>, a long-dead Fortran-based symbolic
computing package. Cosell, working at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies target=_blank>BBN</a>, created this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_LISP target=_blank>BBN Lisp</a>
version from Weizenbaum's paper (see above), <i>not</i> from the SLIP
code. Nevertheless, as SLIP never saw the popularity of Lisp, this is
the version of Eliza that most folks have used, and from which most
lisp-based Elizas derive. (A separate BASIC fork, not based upon
either the Lisp or SLIP versions, was popular on early PCs. See below.)

<p>

Bernie writes: "I *never* saw any of the SLIP code and knew nothing
about it. I wrote Doctor *completely* working just from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM target=_blank>CACM</a>
article!  In fact, if the SLIP code actually surfaced, it'd be
interesting to see how different/similar ours were, since I [really]
never saw any of Weizenbaum's code. Truth is that I did Doctor as a
learning hack. Dan Murphy was [and still is] a good friend of mine
from MIT and he was working on bringing up Lisp on the PDP-1b in the
other building at BBN while I was system-czar for the Hospital
Timesharing system on our PDP-1d.  I knew a little Lisp from a course
at MIT, but I figured that the best way to really "get" Lisp was to
write something real.  I had just joined the ACM [I started at BBN in
the fall of '65] and I think Weizenbaum's Eliza article just happened
to be in the very first copy of Communications that I received."

<p>

This release include high resolution TIFF scans of printouts of
Bernie's code, including the Lisp code and scripts. from 1969 and
1972. He also provided a paper tape version from 1966, which I am in
the process of reading, and will make public soon. The release also
includes combined OCRed PDFs of each program and script. The OCR is
not very accurate. I intend to release perfect transcripts as well as
Modern Lisp macros that make this work.

<p>
The original Eliza was moved to the ANFS Q32 at SDC (one of the
(D)ARPA block grant sites) in the mid 1960's. The programmer
responsible was John Burger who was involved with many early AI
efforts. Somehow, John talked to one of the Playboy writers and the
next thing we knew, there was an article in Playboy much to
Weizenbaum's and everybody else's horror. We got all sorts of calls
from therapists who read the article and wanted to contribute their
"expertise" to make the program better.  Eventually we prepared a
stock letter and phone script to put off all of this free consulting.
<p>
The crisis passed when the unstoppable John Burger invited a husband
and wife, both psychology profs at UCLA, to visit SDC and see the
Doctor in action. I was assigned damage control and about lost it when
both visitors laughed and kept saying the program was perfect!
Finally, one of them caught their breath and finished the sentence:
"This program is perfect to show our students just exactly how NOT to
do Rogerian* therapy.  *I think Rogerian was the term used but it's
been a while.
<p>
A little latter we were involved in the (D)ARPA Speech Understanding
Research (SUR) Program and some of the group was there all hours of
day and night. Spouses and significant others tended to visit
particularly in the crazy night hours and kept getting in our way. We
would amuse them by letting them use Eliza on the Q32 Time Sharing
System. One day, the Q32 became unavailable in those off hours for a
long period of time. We had a Raytheon 704 computer in the speech lab
that I thought we could use to keep visitors happy some of the
time. So one weekend I wrote an interpretive Lisp system for the 704
and debugged it the next Monday. The sole purpose of this Lisp was to
support Eliza. Someone else adopted the Q32 version to run on the new
704 Lisp. So in less than a week, while doing our normal work, we had
a new Lisp system running Eliza and keeping visitors happy while we
did our research.
<p>
The 704 Eliza system, with quite a different script, was used to
generate a conversation with a user about the status of a
computer. The dialogue was very similar to one with a human playing
the part of a voice recognition and response system where the lines
are noisy. The human and Eliza dialogues were included/discussed in
A. Newell, et al., "Speech Understanding Systems; Final Report of a
Study Group," Published for Artificial Intelligence by North-Holland/
American Elsevier (1973). The content of that report was all generated
in the late 1960s but not published immediately.
<p>
The web site, <a target=_blank
href=http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/>http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/</a>,
has a little more information about the Raytheon 704 Lisp. The SUR
program was partially funded and on-going by 1970.

<h3><a href=http://shrager.org target=_blank>Jeff Shrager</a>'s BASIC Eliza c. 1973 &amp; 1977</h3>

<p>

<a href=http://shrager.org target=_blank>Jeff Shrager</a> created a <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC>BASIC</a> version of Eliza in
1973 that appeared in Creative Computing in the July/August issue of
1977:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://shrager.org/vita/pubs/1977ElizaCreativeComputing.pdf">[1977 BASIC Eliza in Creative Computing]</a>
<p>

Shrager actually wrote it in 1973. Although he recalls having seen a
copy of the Lisp code much later, his <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC>BASIC</a> Eliza was written
well before this, and was, to use his own words: "conceptual, and
pretty poor."  Regardless, 1977 was around the dawning of the era of
the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer
target=_blank>personal computer</a> (the Commodore PET, Apple ][, and
TRS-80 were all introduced in that year!), and although few folks in
the hobbyist community knew Lisp, lots of them knew Basic, so
Shrager's Eliza was widely circulated and many knock-offs appeared in
many other languages, some as late as 2015. (The latest one I know of
is <a target=_blank href=http://computer-gaga.com/books/eliza-analyzed/1-introduction>Paco
Willers' 2015 GO version</a>.)  Shrager's version has even apparently
been translated back into Lisp a number of times. Indeed, there are
so many near-and-distant knock-offs of this program floating around
that it would be pointless to try to assign any sort of Creative
Commons, or otherwise, license to it.

<p>

The version published in CC in 1977 was under CC editor Steve North's
byline, but Shrager is correctly attributed as the author in the
comments.
<p>
This alternative publication: 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=20">[1984 BASIC Eliza in Big Computer Games]</a>
<p>
gives the correct year of creation of the program as 1973.

<p>

Note that North's text incorrectly attributes the Lisp Eliza to Joseph
Weizenbaum, whereas it was actually written by Bernie Cosell (see
above). This was, and continues to be, a common mistake.

<p>

Paco Willers has undertaken <a target=_blank
href=http://computer-gaga.com/books/eliza-analyzed/1-introduction>a detailed,
nearly line-by-line, deconstruction of the Shrager/North 1973/1977
BASIC code</a>.

<h3>Richard Stallman's GNU EMACS "Doctor"</h3>
<p>

The code for the GNU EMACS "doctor" can be found in the GNU EMACS repo, currently:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=_blank href=http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/play/doctor.el>http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/play/doctor.el</a>
<p>

It begins:

<pre>
;;; doctor.el --- psychological help for frustrated users

;; Copyright (C) 1985, 1987, 1994, 1996, 2000-2013 Free Software
;; Foundation, Inc.

;; Maintainer: FSF
;; Keywords: games

...

;;; Commentary:

;; The single entry point `doctor', simulates a Rogerian analyst using
;; phrase-production techniques similar to the classic ELIZA demonstration
;; of pseudo-AI.
</pre>
<p>
It was most likely written by Richard Stallman. Note this subset of code:
<pre>
 (set (make-local-variable 'doctor--stallmanlst)
       '(((doc$ doctor--describe) your (doc$ doctor--feelings-about) him \.)
        ((doc$ doctor--areyou) a friend of Stallman \?)
	 ((doc$ doctor--bother) Stallman is (doc$ doctor--random-adjective) \?)
	  ((doc$ doctor--ibelieve) you are (doc$ doctor--afraidof) him \.)))
</pre>

It claims to use techniques "similar to the classic Eliza", but
doesn't say whether it is based upon Cosell's Lisp code or
Weizenbaum's paper. Although it is unknown whether Stallman actually
saw Cosell's version, it's pretty likely that he did, being a Lisp
hacker and at MIT around the time that the Lisp version would have
been making the rounds.

<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=_blank
href=http://jeffshrager.org/llisp/26.html>Steve Cherry's 1982 Lisp
Eliza</a> 

<blockquote> 

[Okay, this is crazy: Cherry's version of Eliza appears in a book
called <a target=_blank href=http://shrager.org/llisp>"Learning
Lisp"</a>, which was an imprint of the manual for an Apple ][ Lisp,
written by Cherry, called <a target=_blank
href=http://www.flownet.com/ron/plisp.html>PLisp</a>. Cherry's Eliza
seems mostly based upon Shrager's 1973/1977 BASIC Eliza. (It has
essentially the same key and response structure as Shrager's, but has
a priority system, a ittle like Cosell's. So it's not a direct
translation, but is pretty close.) Shrager's Eliza had been ported to
an Apple ][ at some point, so Cherry would definately have had it
close to hand. Anyway, so bear with me here now: Cherry's PLisp manual
was actually a port of a Lisp textbook written by Shrager and a friend
(Steve Bagley) in about 1979. (See <a
href=http://shrager.org/llisp/preface.html target=_blank>the preface
to Learning Lisp</a>). HOWEVER, <i>Shrager and Bagley's book didn't
include an Eliza !! </i> Cherry apparently added it for either the
PLisp user's manual, or later for the imprinted book version of that
manual. What this means is that Cherry, probably unknowingly, borrowed
(fairly directly) Shrager's BASIC Eliza, which was itself borrowed
(indirectly) by Shrager from a Lisp program, back into a <i>different
Lisp program</i> to appear in a manual/book on Lisp originally
co-authored by Shrager, who wrote the original (BASIC) Eliza that
Cherry based <i>his</i> Lisp Eliza on ... Confusing enough for you!?]

What makes this so interesting is that the implementation language is
"Georgia Tech Language" (?), which seems to be an Algol extended with
Lisp primitives. The resulting code looks like this:

<pre>
P1:  IF ATOM(CADR(NEXT)) THEN BEGIN
     IF CADR(NEXT)=CAR(R) THEN BEGIN
     NEXT:=CDR(NEXT);
     GO TO L1;                  END;
     GO TO L6;   END;
     DL:=IF CAADR(NEXT)= "*" THEN CDADR(NEXT) ELSE CDADADR(NEXT);
     IF MEMBER(CAR(R),DL) THEN BEGIN
     NEXT:=CDR(NEXT);
     GO TO L1;  END;
</pre>

(Note <em><b>CDADADR</b></em> !!)

20171211: My friend and colleague, Michael Wessel, who apparently has
a soft spot for ancient speech synthesizers, recently noted this
curious coincidence/historical anecdote about a German version of my
BASIC Eliza. (Michael and I worked together on the
<a target=_blank href=https://www.sri.com/work/projects/aura>AURA project at SRI</a>
for about a year around 2013.)

<p><p>

Michael writes:

<blockquote>

"About 1985 I typed in a version of your BASIC Eliza from a public
library copy of the 'Creative Computing Computer Games' book, into my
Amstrad CPC 464 home computer. The book had been translated into
German, and so was Eliza! I wish the editors
hadn't done so, as it makes much less sense!

<p>

Back then I owned a speech synthesizer (the Amstrad SSA-1 for the
CPC), and I had extended your BASIC Eliza with speech
capabilities. The audio/speech quality was as awful as some of the TRS
80 speech synths you can hear on YouTube.

<p>

Now, 32 years later or so I am working on a little spare time hobby
project - a modern, understandable speech synthesizer for the Amstrad
CPC, which is designed to be compatible with that original "retro"
Amstrad SSA-1 speech synthesizer. And indeed, the old Eliza that got
extended with SSA-1 speech output is working well with my modern
speech synthesizer."

</blockquote>

<p><p>

<a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTxufTKfrYk>Here's a youtube video of Michael's German-speaking Eliza</a>.

<br>

<a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckCTHi5_2f8>And here is another version for the CPC</a>, also with speech output.

<p><p>

Michael continues:

<blockquote>

"With respect to the second video (the English one), the original
author of this Eliza version also mentions your Eliza as the source for
the program, but he says he extended it significantly, and then I
added speech output, this time using the 'native mode' of my speech
synthesizer, which gives much better speech quality than the emulated
'retro SSA-1' compatibility mode, as you can hear."

</blockquote>

As I mentioned above, Michael and I worked closely together at SRI for
about a year. He concluded his note this way: "It's really a funny and
strange coincidence that our ways have crossed; What are the chances
that you get to work with someone whose BASIC program you typed in
from a public library book 30 years ago? Sometimes, the world is
small!"

<p>

I couldn't agree more!

<a target=_blank href=https://cpcrulez.fr/applications_list_util-elisa.htm>https://cpcrulez.fr/applications_list_util-elisa.htm</a>

<p><p>

To run it:
<ul>
<li>Download extract the DSK image
<li>Go to: http://cpcbox.com, which is a CPC Emulator in Javascript running in the Browser
<li>Select "Choose configuration -> 464"
<li>Select the Eliza DSK file for "DRIVE A:" 
<li>When the CPC boots up, enter "cat"; You should see "ELISA-NS.BAS"
<li>Enter: RUN "ELISA-NS (Without Speech ("NS = no speech")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The other version is with speech, but doesn't work on the emulator)
</ul>

20151122: John D. writes (email to Jeff Shrager of 2015-11-22): "Back in 1979,
Radio Shack released their own commercial version of Eliza for their
TRS-80 Model I, sold in their stores. It was written in machine
language, not Basic, on cassette tape. In fact, the tape had two
versions: a regular one, and a special version that gave Eliza's
response through the expensive Voice Synthesizer they were selling (a
Votrax derivative)."
<p>
"The interesting thing about Radio Shack's version is that it seemed a 
bit more sophisticated than the original Weizenbaum version. It 
recognized more words. (Including swear words--just so it could react 
with 'There's no need for that language.'-- which is weird to see 
inside a mass-market product sold by a major corporation!) And when you 
said "Goodbye" it gave you a diagnosis: everything from "You have no 
psychological problems besides a normal amount of paranoia" to 'I must 
conclude you are dangerously psychotic and should be locked up'!"
<p>
"It was apparently written by Device Oriented Games in Dallas (near
where Radio Shack was based)."

The Votrax quality is terrible, but that makes it all the more fun!

20151013: Paco Willers has written <a target=_blank
